    Explain, at a very basic level, OAuth 2 + OpenID Connect and the problems it solves.
 */
/*
    OAuth 2 is an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an
HTTP service, such as Facebook, GitHub, and DigitalOcean. It works by delegating user authentication to the
service that hosts the user account, and authorizing third-party applications to access the user account.
    OAuth 2 provides authorization flows for web and desktop applications, and mobile devices.

    OpenID allows you to use an existing account to sign in to multiple websites, without needing to create new passwords.
    You may choose to associate information with your OpenID that can be shared with the websites you visit, such
as a name or email address. With OpenID, you control how much of that information is shared with the websites you visit.

    With OpenID, your password is only given to your identity provider, and that provider then confirms your identity to
the websites you visit.  Other than your provider, no website ever sees your password, so you donâ€™t need to worry
about an unscrupulous or insecure website compromising your identity.
